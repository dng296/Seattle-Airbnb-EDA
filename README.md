## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You'll need an Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
In addition, to plot the map similar to what I did, you'll need to install `plotly`
either using `pip`:
      `$ pip install plotly==5.3.1`
or `conda`:
      `$ conda install -c plotly plotly=5.3.1`
To export static image, Kaleido package also needs to be installed
      `$ pip install -U kaleido`
or
      `$ conda install -c conda-forge python-kaleido`

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I studied the Seattle Airbnb dataset from Kaggle to understand

1. When is the busiest time to travel to Seattle and how will the airbnb price change?
2. How does price differ based on different locations?
3. What are other important features (such as accommodation, number of rooms, amenities, etc) that can affect the price?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
The repository includes a `Data` folder with three datasets downloaded from Kaggle, a `figures` folder with plots that I generated, and a Jupyter notebook with all of the code I wrote.

## Results<a name="results"></a>
